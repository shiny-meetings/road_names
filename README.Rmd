# `road_names`

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

## Project Description

An app to find all roads with similar names in US and Canada.

### Required Features 

* Enter any road name and find roads with similar names:  
  - decide if all roads or just a few e.g., 5 roads 
  - decide if speed and any other information should be provided  
  - type of road
* Plot the roads:
  - could be one large map with all roads  
  - {mapgl} based storytelling map 
  
### Challenges

* Querying for similar road names:  
  - decide to use a database or {osmdata}/something else  
  - if a database is to be used: {duckdb}/{duckplyr} or parquet files with {arrow} and {geoarrow}  
  - bundling data files with app for deployment is a challenge (possible to use remote parquet files?)
